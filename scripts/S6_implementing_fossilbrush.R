#### S6 - implementing fossilbrush - shouldn't be necessary #####

## Set ranks for cleaning and acceptable suffixes to be used in dataset
b_ranks <- c("phylum", "class", "order", "family", "genus")
b_suff = list(NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, c("ina", "ella", "etta"))

## Now check for taxonomy issues using check_taxonomy
brach_breakdown <- check_taxonomy(GBIF_brach, suff_set = b_suff, ranks = b_ranks, clean_name = TRUE, resolve_duplicates = TRUE, jump = 5)

## Only real concern is implementation of format_check and clean_taxonomy - other functions concern higher taxonomy, which is already clean enough!

## Now identified issues have been corrected, produce final datasets
GBIF_brach <- check_taxonomy(GBIF_brach, suff_set = b_suff, ranks = b_ranks, clean_name = TRUE, resolve_duplicates = TRUE, jump = 5)$data

## Note: using check_taxonomy to resolve conflicting higher taxonomies for genera is easy but seems to produce nonsense taxonomies
## If retention of this structure is important, advisable to switch this feature off
## However, for richness/rates analysis, not a problem.
